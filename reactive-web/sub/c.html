            <h1>What is <strong>C?</strong></h1>
            <p>C (/siÀê/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.<br><img src="c_logo.png" class="float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail bg-light"> By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.<br> Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems.<br>

C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix.<br> Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.<br> During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.<br> Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.<br> C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization.<br>

C is an imperative procedural language.<br> It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.<br> Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.<br> A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.<br> The language is available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.<br>
