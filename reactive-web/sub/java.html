            <h1>What is <strong>Java?</strong></h1>
            <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented (although not a pure object-oriented language, as it contains primitive types[unreliable source?]), and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.<br> <img src="java_logo.png" class="float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail bg-light">
                It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.<br> The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<br>

                Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.<br> The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.<br> As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License.<br> Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).<br>

                The latest versions are Java 13, released in September 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020.<br> Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.<br>Since Java 9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java 11 (Java 13 is also a non-LTS option).</p>

<p>The TIOBE programming language popularity index graph from 2002 to 2018. Java is steadily on the top since mid-2015.<br><img src="duke.png" class="float-right img-fluid img-thumbnail bg-light">
James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee. designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar. Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.<br>

In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.<br>

On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software, (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.<br>

Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist. Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Micro-systems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency. did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section). Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers. April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.<br>

    In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.</p>
